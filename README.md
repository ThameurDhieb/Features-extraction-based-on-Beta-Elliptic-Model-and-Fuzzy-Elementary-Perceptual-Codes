# Features-extraction-based-on-Beta-Elliptic-Model-and-Fuzzy-Elementary-Perceptual-Codes
The presented code consists of the preprocessing and the segmentation of online handwriting into a sequence of Beta strokes. After that, from each Beta stroke, we extract a set of static and dynamic features using four features extraction techniques based on the Beta-Elliptic model and the Fuzzy Elementary Perceptual Codes. Then, all the segments which are composed of N consecutive Beta strokes are categorized into groups and subgroups according to their position and their geometric characteristics.      - The first features extraction technique using  Beta-Elliptic model called the Advanced Overlapped Beta Strategy (AOBS).  - The second features extraction technique using  Beta-Elliptic model called the Simplified Beta Strategy (SBS).  - The third features extraction technique using  combination between Advanced Overlapped Beta Strategy and Fuzzy Elementary Perceptual Codes (AOBSFEPC).  - The fourth features extraction technique using  combination between Simplified Beta Strategy and Fuzzy Elementary Perceptual Codes (SBSFEPC).
